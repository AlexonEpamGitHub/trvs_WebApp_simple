  // The connection string below is now configured to reference a secret manager (e.g., Azure Key Vault).
  // Developers should ensure that the application is properly set up to retrieve secrets securely.
  // To configure Azure Key Vault:
  // 1. Set up Azure Key Vault and add the connection string as a secret.
  // 2. Grant access to the application using Azure Managed Identity or a Service Principal.
  // 3. Update the application code to retrieve the secret using Azure SDK or relevant libraries.
  // 4. Ensure proper permissions and security measures are in place.
